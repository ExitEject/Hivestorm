# Hivestorm Preparation
Hardening AD / Windows / Linux for Hivestorm 2023

This was my first competition. I was quite unprepared in many ways, but it was a great experience and a great reason for me to start diving into more IR/SOC tools and procedures.

My university provided some Windows / Linux cheat-sheets, along with other PDFs for common checklists/benchmarks.

What I wish I had done better:
Prepared the VMs (extracting and loading the image) for the machines before the competition started.
Had tools / scripts ready and on-hand when the competition began.
Had more experience with SOC / blue-team tools, techniques, etc.
